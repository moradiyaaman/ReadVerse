By Photo Pro

Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Photography

Digital photography has revolutionized how we capture, edit, and share images. Whether you're a beginner with a smartphone or someone investing in a professional camera, understanding the fundamentals will dramatically improve your photography skills.

Chapter 2: Camera Basics

Understanding Your Camera:
- DSLR vs Mirrorless vs Point-and-Shoot
- Camera sensors and image quality
- Lens types and their uses
- Camera controls and settings

Essential Camera Settings:
- Aperture (f-stop)
- Shutter Speed
- ISO sensitivity
- White Balance
- Focus modes

Chapter 3: The Exposure Triangle

The exposure triangle consists of three fundamental elements:

Aperture:
Controls depth of field and amount of light entering the camera
- Wide aperture (f/1.4) = Shallow depth of field
- Narrow aperture (f/16) = Deep depth of field

Shutter Speed:
Controls motion blur and light exposure time
- Fast shutter (1/1000s) = Freeze motion
- Slow shutter (1/30s) = Motion blur

ISO:
Controls sensor sensitivity to light
- Low ISO (100-400) = Less noise, better quality
- High ISO (1600+) = More noise, good for low light

Chapter 4: Composition Techniques

Great photos are made through thoughtful composition:

Rule of Thirds:
Divide your frame into nine sections and place subjects along the lines or intersections.

Leading Lines:
Use natural or architectural lines to guide the viewer's eye through the image.

Framing:
Use elements in the scene to create a natural frame around your subject.

Symmetry and Patterns:
Look for repeating elements or perfect symmetry in your compositions.
